Description: The R package calfsbm provides functionality for the CALF-SBM
	     model in network analysis
      (1) Allows the user to generate simulated networks, with
      customizable size, density, and signal strength of covariates
      (2) Run MCMC chains for both real-world and simulated networks
      with help from the NIMBLE package (the chains run slowly and
      may need to be run on a high-performance computing system)
      (3) Post-processing of MCMC samples, accounting for label-switching
