## Research Plan

- Build a probabilistic model in a Bayesian framework for community detection.
- The model is expected to catch network structure and node-based covariates simultaneously.
- The number of communities is UNKNOWN, and it should be self-learned by the algorithm.
- Potential applications are social networks or biological networks (to be determined).
