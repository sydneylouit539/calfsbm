This serves as a basic guide to all the code in the repository. There are many functions, some of which may not be clear in meaning. 

\section{R Libraries}
The following libraries are used:
\newline arm: Andrew Gelman's package to compute logistic regression in a Bayesian context
\newline bcdc: 
\newline igraph: Ubiquitous package for network analysis topics, included just in case
\newline Latentnet: From Handcock's 2007 RSS paper, this package is used to investigate how they optimized fixed number of clusters through BIC
\newline MASS: Used for the multivariate normal simulation to generate sample network for our model
\newline nett: From ArXiv paper, used to compute NMI, and to evaluate clustering with unknown # of communities
\newline network: Occasionally used to make network objects
\newline nimble: Used to write some code in RNimble
\newline raster: Used to plot adjacency matrix, as additional visualization
\section{Functions}
\subsection*{plot_conn}
This function can plot the observed adjacency matrix, along with the actual underlying probabilities
\subsection*{gen_factor}
It is necessary to set up the matrix forlogistic regression, so gen_factor() helps to organize the data into the necessary format
\subsection*{makesymmetric}
Simple function to make a matrix symmetric (intended for undirected networks)
\subsection*{gen_az}
Generate adjacency and node membership from probabilities
\subsection*{gen_az_ln}
Similar function to gen_az(), but does so according to latentnet
\subsection*{find_K_optimal}
Function to find the optimal number of clusters
\subsection*{sim_study_k_finder}

\subsection*{update_beta}
Function to update beta using Bayesian logistic regression
\subsection*{update_z_from_beta}
Updates node membership from beta matrix using likelihood function
\subsection*{convergence_procedure}
\subsection*{gibbs_sampler_fixed_k}
\subsection*{gibbs_sampler_unknown_k}
\subsection*{find_k_best_bic}
\subsection*{mfm_sbm}
\subsection*{update_z_from_q}
\subsection*{serialize}
