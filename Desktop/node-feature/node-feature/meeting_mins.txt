9/8
 - Improve MCMC results table according to screenshot
 - Sensitivity analysis for different n and K
 - Generate thetas from a normal distribution with mean 0 and a prior for variance
 - Look into using multiple chains for RNimble
 - Add an MCMC diagnostic to avoid looking at hundreds of trace plots
9/1
 - Set up GitLab repo
 - Clean up display of results by using RMarkdown and converting to LaTeX table
 - Consider increasing the number of nodes
 - Put together a slide with the agenda for next week's meeting
 - Experiment with K-medians as a starting point

8/25
 - Add an argument to customize the generation of the matrix of covariates
 - Change notation from X[i, j] to S[i, j] in the code to reflect manuscript edits
 - Simulation study with theta_i and theta_j terms
 - Vary the number of groups, such as K = {2, 3, 4}

5/26
 - Experiment with initial values
 - Don't rule out dynamic estimation approach
 - Finish cleaning up code blocks and push a mini-guide into the repo 
 - No meetings until August, but communication by email
5/12
 - Investigate how the indexing affects the SBM element of the model
 - Consider putting the project on hiatus until after internship

4/28
 - How does the JASA paper check for convergence if dimension of Q is changing?
 - What criterion are the authors using for convergence?

4/21
 - Add coverage for all beta effects
 - Separate general purpose code
 - Save full results (post burn-in and thin), and export
 - Continue working on Algorithm 1 before trying to implement in NIMBLE
4/14
 - Apply ideas from JASA paper in the unknown clusters model
 - With simulation study on known K, add variables on mean and 
   standard error

3/31
 - Run simulation study on cluster with known number of clusters
 - Implement methodology from JASA paper

3/24
 - Pull back on simulation study
 - Finish NIMBLE code for known number of clusters model
 - Read JASA paper for insights on cluster updating

3/17
 - Using one dataset, conduct large-scale simulation study on cluster
 - Get burn-in and thinning values for that specific dataset
 - Set K to around 4 or 5, and make 500 replicates
 - Results should include credible intervals for beta, beta0, and K
 - All distributions should have priors

Main issues:
- Current model will not always converge or get stuck in low probability space,
  may be resolved by making bigger jumps or by fully utilizing NIMBLE
- Simulation study needs to be more 'fair' - cannot be based precisely on 
  the assumptions of one model
